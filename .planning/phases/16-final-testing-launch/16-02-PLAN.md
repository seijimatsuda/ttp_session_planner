<objective>
Execute comprehensive manual testing across all target desktop browsers

Purpose: Verify the complete application works correctly on desktop browsers before moving to mobile/tablet testing. Desktop testing catches most issues and is easier to debug than mobile.

Output: Desktop browser testing matrix with pass/fail status for all critical user flows

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Test Chrome on macOS</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Execute full user flow testing on Chrome (latest) on macOS:

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Navigate to https://ttp-session-planner.vercel.app
2. Click "Sign Up" link
3. Create new account (email: chrome-test+[timestamp]@example.com, password: Test123!)
4. Verify redirect to /drills or /dashboard
5. Verify session persists after page refresh (F5)
6. Click Logout
7. Login with same credentials
8. Verify successful login

**Drill Management:**
1. Navigate to /drills/new
2. Create drill: Name="Chrome Test Drill", Category="Passing", Players=8
3. Verify redirect to drill detail
4. Navigate to /drills
5. Verify drill appears in library
6. Use search to find "Chrome Test"
7. Use category filter to show "Passing" only
8. Click drill card to view detail
9. Edit drill: change name to "Chrome Test Drill Updated"
10. Verify changes saved
11. Delete drill (confirm in dialog)
12. Verify drill removed from library

**Media Upload (if test video available):**
1. Create new drill
2. Upload test video (< 10MB .mp4)
3. Verify progress bar shows during upload
4. Verify upload completes
5. Navigate to drill detail
6. Verify video plays
7. Verify video scrubbing works (seek to 50%, 75%)

**Session Planner:**
1. Create a test drill first
2. Navigate to /sessions/new
3. Verify drill library sidebar loads
4. Drag drill into grid cell (Activation row, column 1)
5. Verify drill appears in cell
6. Click drill in sidebar, then click different cell (click-to-place)
7. Remove drill from cell (click X)
8. Save session: name="Chrome Test Session"
9. Navigate to /sessions
10. Verify session in list
11. Load session
12. Verify drills populate grid
13. Delete session

Document all results with PASS/FAIL status.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Test Safari, Firefox, and Edge</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Execute streamlined testing on remaining desktop browsers. Focus on areas most likely to differ from Chrome.

**Safari (macOS):**
Critical tests (Safari-specific concerns):
1. Auth flow: signup, login, session persistence
2. Video playback: play, pause, seek (Safari has different video codec handling)
3. Drag-and-drop: may have different pointer event handling
4. CSS: flexbox/grid rendering

Run abbreviated test suite:
- [ ] Signup/Login works
- [ ] Create drill with all fields
- [ ] Video uploads and plays
- [ ] Video scrubbing works
- [ ] Drag-and-drop works
- [ ] Click-to-place works
- [ ] Session save/load works

**Firefox (macOS or Windows):**
Critical tests (Firefox-specific concerns):
1. Auth flow: cookie handling may differ
2. Form validation: Firefox has different validation styling
3. Drag-and-drop: Firefox DnD API implementation

Run abbreviated test suite:
- [ ] Signup/Login works
- [ ] Create drill with form validation
- [ ] Drag-and-drop works
- [ ] Session save/load works

**Edge (Windows):**
Critical tests (Edge is Chromium-based, should match Chrome):
1. Auth flow: verify Edge-specific storage APIs
2. Quick verification of main flows

Run abbreviated test suite:
- [ ] Signup/Login works
- [ ] Create drill works
- [ ] Drag-and-drop works

Document any browser-specific issues found.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Desktop browser testing completed on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge. All critical user flows tested:
- Authentication (signup, login, logout, session persistence)
- Drill management (create, edit, delete, search, filter)
- Media upload and video playback
- Session planner (drag-drop, click-to-place, save, load)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Review the test results document at .planning/phases/16-final-testing-launch/16-02-DESKTOP-TESTS.md
2. Confirm all critical tests pass (or document known issues)
3. Verify no blocking issues prevent mobile testing
4. If any tests failed, determine if they are blockers or can be deferred

Key verification:
- Video playback works on Safari (this is critical for iOS)
- Drag-and-drop works on all browsers
- No JavaScript console errors during normal usage
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if desktop testing passed (or issues are documented as non-blocking)
Type "issues: [description]" if blocking issues found that need resolution
